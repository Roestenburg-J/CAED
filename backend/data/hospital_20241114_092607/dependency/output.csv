column_1,column_2,column_1_name,column_2_name,dependency
0,1,index,ProviderNumber,"The unique record ID (column 0) corresponds to a specific entry or hospital identifier (column 1). This forms an index relationship, establishing that each unique ID corresponds to a specific hospital indicating a dependency."
1,2,ProviderNumber,HospitalName,"The first column contains an identifier or code that is likely associated with the hospital or facility, while the second column identifies the hospital name. There is a semantic dependency because each code relates specifically to 'huntsville hospital'."
1,3,ProviderNumber,Address1,"The address details in column 3 may suggest connections with the hospital identifier in column 1, particularly for sorting or identifying local entities."
1,6,ProviderNumber,City,"The postal code indicates the geographical area for the hospital, which is consistently linked to a specific hospital name in the dataset."
1,11,ProviderNumber,HospitalType,"The code representing the facility (first column) is semantically dependent on the type of facility (second column), as the same type of facility generally corresponds to a specific set of codes."
1,14,ProviderNumber,Condition,"The code representing the facility (first column) is semantically dependent on the specific care condition (fourteenth column), as certain care conditions are associated with particular facilities."
1,15,ProviderNumber,MeasureCode,"The value in column 1 (hospital identifier) is correlated with different quality measures identified in column 15 (metric identifier) for the same hospital, suggesting a semantic dependency."
1,17,ProviderNumber,Score,The hospital ID column correlates with the percentage of pneumonia patients given smoking cessation advice to indicate the reporting structure unique to that hospital.
2,3,HospitalName,Address1,The hospital's name in one column is directly related to its address as represented in another column.
2,11,HospitalName,HospitalType,"The name of the medical center (column 2) is likely to determine or be related to the type of facility it is categorized as (column 11). That is, the type of reporting (acute care hospitals) is expected to correspond with the specific medical center names."
2,12,HospitalName,HospitalOwner,"The values in the column that describes hospital names determine the type of organization (voluntary non-profit, government, etc.) in the column that describes hospital categories."
2,14,HospitalName,Condition,"The column indicating the condition type ('heart attack', 'heart failure', etc.) has a dependency on the column denoting the care facility name, suggesting that the facility provides specific care for those conditions."
3,9,Address1,CountyName,"The column with county names has a potential dependency on the corresponding column of addresses, as hospitals within the same county may share similar location patterns."
4,5,Address2,Address3,"Both columns contain repeated instances of 'empty', which indicates potential redundancy and a lack of data for those specific fields across records."
6,7,City,State,The geographical area where the hospital is located has a direct relationship with the state code represented in a different column.
6,8,City,ZipCode,"The value indicating the city or location in column 6 corresponds with the state code in column 7, which is a semantic relationship suggesting that these cities belong to the same state."
7,8,State,ZipCode,"The state abbreviation in one column indicates the state of the hospital address, and the zip code in the second column relates to the geographic location of the hospital. There is a semantic dependency where the zip code corresponds to a specific location within that state."
11,12,HospitalType,HospitalOwner,"The type of hospital organization classified in one column generally reflects the nature of care types provided, evident through the hospital's services indicated in another."
11,14,HospitalType,Condition,"The column that describes hospital type (acute care hospitals) has a dependency with the column that describes a specific condition (pneumonia), as every hospital in the data appears to treat pneumonia."
11,15,HospitalType,MeasureCode,"Both columns show an established relationship since they represent the same condition (pneumonia) being treated in hospitals, indicating organized treatment for this specific illness."
12,15,HospitalOwner,MeasureCode,"The categorization of the facility (twelfth column) is semantically dependent on the specific care measure (fifteenth column), indicating that certain categories are required to report certain measures."
14,15,Condition,MeasureCode,The category of medical treatment indicator (14) and the specific performance measure identifier (15) share a semantic dependency; this identifier indicates a specific measure related to the medical treatment category.
14,16,Condition,MeasureName,The category of medical treatment indicator (14) and the description of the medical treatment outcome (16) share a semantic dependency; the outcome is related to the treatment category specified.
14,18,Condition,Sample,"The column representing the number of patients has a dependency on the condition type ('heart attack'), implying that data regarding the number of patients is tied to specific heart attack interventions."
14,19,Condition,Stateavg,"The unique measure ID derived from the relationship to healthcare quality measures indicates which type of healthcare condition it's assessed against, contributing to a dependency."
15,16,MeasureCode,MeasureName,The column labeled as the identifier (which appears to denote a specific type of care or treatment) has a clear semantic dependency with the column that describes the type of care or treatment. The identifier relates to a specific process or measure which is explained in detail in the descriptive column.
15,19,MeasureCode,Stateavg,The identifier linked to a health condition or treatment is semantically related to the specific condition represented in another column.
16,18,MeasureName,Sample,"The column representing the number of patients has a dependency on the measure description, indicating how many patients were involved in each specific assessment or treatment."
17,18,Score,Sample,"The percentage of patients receiving a specific treatment is likely related to the number of patients documented in the second column. There is a logical dependency, as the percentage represents a calculation derived from the total number of patients."
