0,1,index,id,"The first column appears to be a unique identifier for each beer, while the second column appears to represent a unique value associated with the beer (possibly a catalog number or product number). This suggests a syntactic dependency where the unique identifier may relate to the unique value."
1,2,id,beer-name,"Brew ID (column 1) might be a unique identifier that determines the beer name (column 2), suggesting a single beer corresponds to a unique identifier."
1,6,id,ibu,"The numerical identifier of the beer corresponds to its general alcohol content level; therefore, the ID number may be related to the beer's alcohol level."
1,7,id,brewery-id,"The unique identifier for the beer (represented by the first column) may correspond to the batch number (represented by the second column) managed by the brewery, suggesting a structure of inventory management."
1,8,id,brewery-name,"The second column with a suggested product value could have a syntactic or semantic dependency on the eighth column, which represents the brewery name, indicating that products listed under the same brewery likely have similar pricing patterns."
2,3,beer-name,style,"The name of the beer (column 2) determines its type (column 3), as each beer name is associated with a specific beer style."
2,4,beer-name,ounces,"The fourth column represents the size of the beer's packaging, which semantically relates to the beer name in the second column, as the name may suggest packaging size conventions."
2,5,beer-name,abv,"The fifth column includes the alcohol percentage of the beer, suggesting a semantic dependency on the beer name in the second column, where specific beer names could imply certain alcohol content ranges."
4,5,ounces,abv,The description of container size (described in the fourth column) might imply an expected alcohol content representation (described in the fifth column). There is a clear pattern of container size being consistent with the representation of the alcohol percentage.
5,6,abv,ibu,"The alcohol by volume (ABV) percentage (column 5) may be semantically related to the sweetness or flavor profile represented in the other column (column 6), although column 6 may contain null values."
7,10,brewery-id,state,"The common identifier for the entries (column 7), likely a unique identifier for the record, does not have a direct dependency with the state abbreviation (column 10), however they both relate to the same brewing company and city."
8,9,brewery-name,city,"The brewery name in one column is likely related to the city in another column, indicating a semantic dependency where the brewery is based in that city."
9,10,city,state,The city indicated in the ninth column suggests a context that is validated by the state shown in the tenth column. This indicates a semantic dependency as each city would correspond to its respective state.
