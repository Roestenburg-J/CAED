0,1,tuple_id,src,The source system or application name (column indicating the service providing flight information) could have a dependency on the unique identifier (column with a numeric ID) since each record comes from a specific source that categorizes its entries distinctly.
0,2,tuple_id,flight,"The flight number, which includes carrier and route information, may have a dependency on the unique identifier (column with a numeric ID) as each flight must be uniquely identifiable in the records."
1,2,src,flight,"The values in the column representing the name of the flight service (e.g., 'flights', 'gofox', etc.) are semantically dependent on the specific flight code and route (e.g., 'AA-271-MIA-LAX'), as these flight services are likely reporting or tracking the same flight."
2,3,flight,sched_dep_time,"The flight code column indicates specific flight information, and therefore any departure time listed here must align with the same flight code."
2,4,flight,act_dep_time,"The flight number column could suggest a typical departure time associated with specific routes provided by the airline, indicating a relationship between flight routes and their scheduled departure times."
2,5,flight,sched_arr_time,"The flight identifier (column 2) relates to the final arrival time (column 5), providing a timeline of the flight's journey."
2,6,flight,act_arr_time,"The flight identifier (column 2) is associated with the status or additional timing related to the flight (column 6), which could indicate a delay or another relevant update."
3,4,sched_dep_time,act_dep_time,"The values in the column representing the scheduled departure time have a dependency on the values in the column representing the actual departure time, indicating that they may not always match."
3,5,sched_dep_time,sched_arr_time,The departure time (3) may have a dependency on the last known update time (5) as both relate to the temporal sequencing of events for the flight.
3,6,sched_dep_time,act_arr_time,The departure time (column 3) may correlate with updates or follow-up times (column 6) regarding the flight's status.
4,5,act_dep_time,sched_arr_time,There is a potential dependency where the scheduled departure time (column) can influence or relate to specific estimated arrival times across multiple records.
4,6,act_dep_time,act_arr_time,"The scheduled arrival times (column) and the actual arrival times logged might correspond based on the same flight reference, where the first indicates expectation and the second indicates reality."
5,6,sched_arr_time,act_arr_time,"The values in the column representing the scheduled arrival time have a dependency on the values in the column representing the actual arrival time, indicating that they may not always match."
