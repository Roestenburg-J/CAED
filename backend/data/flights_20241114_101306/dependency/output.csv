0,1,tuple_id,src,"The first column possibly represents an identifier for each record, while the second column provides the name of the source reporting the flight information. This indicates a dependency where each identifier may correspond to a unique source."
0,2,tuple_id,flight,"The first column as an identifier is likely related to the third column, which represents flight numbers that appear to be unique flights associated with each identifier."
1,2,src,flight,"The values in the second column reference various flight service providers, while the third column represents a specific flight identifier (UA-2830-MCO-CLT). This indicates a semantic dependency where the service provider (column 1) provides services for the specific flight (column 2)."
1,3,src,sched_dep_time,"The second column (airline) may relate to the third column, as some airlines provide specific times indicated in the third column, likely corresponding to multiple timings provided later."
1,4,src,act_dep_time,"The second column, representing airlines, could have a dependency on the departure times in the fourth column, likely providing specific patterns or scheduling related to the airline's operations."
2,3,flight,sched_dep_time,"The third column denotes a specific flight number involving certain departure and arrival procedures, while the fourth column indicates its scheduled departure timeâ€”implying that the flight number has an inherent relation to the scheduled departure."
2,4,flight,act_dep_time,The values in the column representing flight routes (with airline and airports) correspond to values in the column representing departure times. Each route is associated with a specific departure time.
2,5,flight,sched_arr_time,The flight code in the first column correlates with arrival timings in the fourth column.
2,6,flight,act_arr_time,The flight code in the first column is connected to additional arrival timings in the fifth column.
3,4,sched_dep_time,act_dep_time,"The values in the third column represent scheduled departure times of the flight, and the fourth column represents the actual departure times. The departure times suggest a direct dependency where each scheduled time is expected to match or relate closely to the actual departure time."
3,5,sched_dep_time,sched_arr_time,"The fourth column, potentially representing scheduled departure times, and the fifth column, likely indicating time changes, suggest a dependency where if 'arrival time' is not null, it's directly related to the scheduled departure time."
4,5,act_dep_time,sched_arr_time,The values in the fourth column denote the actual departure times while the fifth column indicates the arrival times. The arrival times are dependent on when the flight departed.
4,6,act_dep_time,act_arr_time,"The fourth column represents departure times, while the sixth column represents arrival times, indicating a direct temporal relationship between when a flight departs and when it arrives."
5,6,sched_arr_time,act_arr_time,"The fifth column represents the scheduled arrival times, while the sixth column shows actual arrival times. Each set of actual arrival times depends upon the corresponding scheduled arrival times."
