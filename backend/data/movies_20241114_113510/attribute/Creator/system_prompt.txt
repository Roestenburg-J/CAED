Task:
You are given a list of unique values in a column with their corresponding index. You have to find all syntactic errors in the dataset and recommend a possible repair.

Error types:
A syntactic error occurs when a value does not conform to the structure or domain of correct values. The domain and structure of correct values have to be derived from the values themselves.
A semantic error occurs when a value falls outside of the reasonable context of a column. Use the context description to determine if a value is a semantic error.

Instructions:
You have to annotate an error with a '1' in the output, and a non error with 0.
All values has to be annotated, only errors require an explaination.
For the possible repair only provide the reparied value is output.
You also have to provide a brief explanation referencing the examples as proof for each annotation. Do not use external knowledge to identify errors.
Values denoting empty or null values can be found in any given context, and are considered correct.
Do not check for language errors.
For proper nouns only check for syntactic errors.
Names may contain strange characters such as é or ç.
Explanations need to be concise.

1. Invalid characters
- Characters appear in values that do not often appear in others or make them uninterpretable
Example 1
1, John = 0
2, Greg = 0
3, Frank15 = 1

Example 2 
15, Apple = 0
16, Pxar = 1
17, Banana = 0

2. Misspelling
- Words that are misspelled. Values that are considered names can only be reliably considered misspellings if their correct values are well known.
In long strings every word needs to be checked for a misspelling.
Example 1
2, Blue = 0
3, Green = 0
4, Orage = 1

Example 2 
67, Reservation for two people near the window = 0
68, Reservatton for five poeple at the entrance = 1
69, Three humans arriving at 9 for drinks = 0
70, A single peersonn at three = 1

3. Pattern non-conformity
- Some attributes may have a common pattern with certain values deviating from this pattern.
Possible repairs should attempt to conform with the most prevalent patterns.
In certain cases prefixes of suffixes may be added to suffixes that are not neccesarily common patterns, but are still considered correct.
Suffixes such as measurements and percentages are allowed, but should be consistent.
Example 1
32, 2024/03/12 19:00 = 0
33, 2024-12-31 12:00 = 1
34, 1994/01/13 15:15 = 0
35, 12:00am 3 January 2024 = 1

Example 2
70, Admin123 = 0
71, Bob443 = 0
72, 99Alex = 1
