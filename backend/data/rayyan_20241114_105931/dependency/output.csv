0,1,id,article_title,"The identifier for each record (column 0) likely serves as a unique key that distinguishes individual articles or records from each other, hence it determines the meaning and existence of the title of the article in column 1."
0,3,id,journal_title,"The first column serves as a unique identifier for articles, while the third column may represent the source or publication that the article is associated with. The relationship implies that each identifier can accurately trace back to the source of the research."
0,5,id,journal_issn,"The first column represents a unique identifier for research entries, and the fifth column contains a publication identifier (likely ISSN or similar). This establishes a dependency since the publication information can be linked back to specific articles using their unique identifiers."
0,6,id,article_jvolumn,"The unique identifier in the first column could correlate with a numeric value in the sixth column, potentially representing a measurable aspect related to the specific literature, such as a citation count or impact score."
0,7,id,article_jissue,"There is a numeric value in the seventh column that may also be dependent on the unique identifier in the first column, perhaps indicating some rating or relevance score related to the literature entries."
0,9,id,article_pagination,"The first column is a unique identifier of research articles, and the ninth column appears to represent a date related to the article's relevance or discussion. This infers a dependency where each article ID relates to specific date information."
0,10,id,author_list,"The list of authors (column 10) is generally associated with the unique identifier for each record (column 0), meaning that the authors listed are only related to the specific article identifiable by that unique number."
1,2,article_title,article_language,"The language of publication (represented by the second column) relates to the title of the paper (represented by the first column), indicating that titles might have an associated language of publication when the language is specified."
1,3,article_title,journal_title,"The journal name (represented by the third column) is related to the title of the paper (represented by the first column), suggesting that specific titles might be published in specific journals."
1,5,article_title,journal_issn,"The title of the paper (represented by the first column) may have links to the corresponding research focus or subject area (represented by the fifth column) when defined, suggesting a thematic dependency."
1,6,article_title,article_jvolumn,"The title of each article (column 1) appears to relate to the value in column 6, which could represent an abstract or significance score, indicating that the content of the title may influence the associated value measuring its relevance or focus."
1,7,article_title,article_jissue,"The title or description in the second column may correlate with the numeric value in the seventh column, suggesting that the quality or significance of the literature is being reflected in this score."
1,8,article_title,article_jcreated_at,"The title of each article (column 1) likely has a dependency on the publication date (column 8), suggesting that articles on similar topics may have a similar timeframe of publication."
1,9,article_title,article_pagination,"The title of the article (column 1) may correspond to the citation section (column 9), as the mentioned articles or content in this section can be derived or referenced based on the topic described in the title."
1,10,article_title,author_list,"The names of authors associated with a publication (tenth column) directly correlate with the title of the study (second column), indicating that the author list semantically depends on the specific study title."
3,4,journal_title,jounral_abbreviation,"The journal name (third column) appears to relate to its abbreviated citation style (fourth column), indicating that the full journal name may semantically depend on its abbreviation."
5,6,journal_issn,article_jvolumn,"The publication date format (fifth column) shows a pattern that may correlate with the volume number (sixth column) in a journal, implying a possible dependency where the date contextually relates to the volume number."
6,7,article_jvolumn,article_jissue,"The volume number (sixth column) may correlate with the issue number (seventh column), suggesting a semantic dependency where a specific volume contains various issues."
6,8,article_jvolumn,article_jcreated_at,"The numeric value in the sixth column could express a metric that has a time-based relationship with the date in the eighth column, suggesting that the measure may vary over time since publication."
7,8,article_jissue,article_jcreated_at,"The numeric value in the seventh column may relate to the date in the eighth column, possibly indicating a relationship between the score or rating obtained and the timeframe of the literature."
8,9,article_jcreated_at,article_pagination,"The publication date presented in a specific format (eighth column) may relate to a unique identifier of the article within the journal (ninth column), suggesting a syntactic dependency where dates delineate issues tied to publication identifiers."
