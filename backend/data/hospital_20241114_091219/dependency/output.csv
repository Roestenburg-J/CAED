14,19,Condition,Stateavg,The prefix in the identifier relates to the type of medical condition or treatment described in the other column.
15,16,MeasureCode,MeasureName,The pneumonia codes in this column also rely directly on the corresponding descriptions that detail the treatment protocols or outcomes specific to pneumonia patients.
15,17,MeasureCode,Score,"The measure codes (e.g., ami-2, hf-2) relate to percentages showing the adherence or performance level related to that specific quality measure, indicating a syntactic dependency where the code corresponds to a specific quality performance percentage."
