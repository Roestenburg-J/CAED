0,1,tuple_id,src,The first column represents a unique identifier which may depend on the associated airline or service provider in the second column.
0,2,tuple_id,flight,The flight identifier in the third column (a string that represents a specific flight route) relies on the unique number in the first column (which likely represents a unique ID for each record). Each flight identifier corresponds to a specific record ID.
0,5,tuple_id,sched_arr_time,"The unique identifiers for each flight could correlate with specific scheduling details, suggesting that each unique ID may relate to precise informative timings."
1,2,src,flight,"The third column represents a specific flight identifier, which likely depends on the airline or service provider in the second column, as the flight identifier is formatted to include the airline (UA) and the route."
1,3,src,sched_dep_time,The fourth column represents the scheduled departure time which may be influenced by the airline in the second column.
1,4,src,act_dep_time,The fifth column represents the scheduled arrival time which may be influenced by the airline in the second column.
1,5,src,sched_arr_time,The sixth column represents the recorded arrival time which may be influenced by the airline in the second column.
2,3,flight,sched_dep_time,"The flight identifier in one column indicates a specific flight, while the departure time in another column represents when that flight is scheduled to leave."
2,4,flight,act_dep_time,"Flight codes in the relevant column could have specific scheduled times associated to them, such that knowing one might provide insights into the other."
2,5,flight,sched_arr_time,"The flight number column also correlates with gate arrival times, indicating that specific flights arrive at certain gates within a predictable time frame."
2,6,flight,act_arr_time,"The values in the column representing flight codes may determine the values in the column representing arrival times, as each flight code is associated with specific outgoing and incoming timings."
3,4,sched_dep_time,act_dep_time,"The scheduled departure time in the fourth column may have a dependency on the scheduled arrival time in the fifth column, suggesting the timing of each is linked."
3,5,sched_dep_time,sched_arr_time,"The scheduled departure time in the fourth column is related to the actual arrival time in the sixth column, possibly indicating delays or on-time arrivals based on the flight's schedule."
4,5,act_dep_time,sched_arr_time,"The scheduled arrival time in the fifth column may have a dependency on the recorded arrival time in the sixth column, indicating that the two times are closely related."
4,6,act_dep_time,act_arr_time,The departure time column (describing the time a flight departs) and the arrival time column (describing the time a flight arrives) are syntactically dependent. The values in these columns represent time entries that are likely based on the same scheduled flight.
5,6,sched_arr_time,act_arr_time,"Each recorded time in the fifth column (potentially representing scheduled arrival times) is related to the subsequent times in the sixth column (representing actual arrival times), with a possible semantic dependency where the 'scheduled' arrival time often relates to the 'actual' recorded arrival time."
