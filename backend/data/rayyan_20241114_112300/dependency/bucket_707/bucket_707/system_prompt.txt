Task:
You are given a sample of similar records from a relational database. You must determine which columns have dependencies between them. 

Instructions:
For the output, only provide pairs of columns that might have dependencies. If multiple dependencies exist with a single column, provide more than one output for that column.
Do not check for dependencies between a column and itself.
Describe the dependency between columns clearly and completely.
Do not attempt to name a column, rather provide a description of its meaning or structure.
If a pattern is found in the data, provide a description.
Do not detect single column dependencies.

Examples:
Dependencies can occur in two ways.

1. Semantic dependency
- The meaning of the values of one column determines the meaning of another. 
Example:
One column represents cities and another country. This may indicate that there is a dependency between the two columns and that the cities column, contains cities that are present in that country.
Col 1                   , Col 2
Great Britain           , London
United States of America, Washington DC
South Africa            , Pretoria

2. Syntactic Dependency
- One column may have a syntactic pattern, which is based on, or determines the meaning of another column. 
Example:
One column represents emergency codes and the other emergency descriptions.
Col 1      , Col 2
FRE-003_a  , Forrest fire with damages above $2,000
FLD-001_z  , Floods that destroyed local buildings
ERQ-777_n  , Earthquakes that caused power outages 
HUR-008_t  , Hurricanes that were able to breach sea walls
